# SF-Muni

Web Application of real-time positions of San Francisco's buses and trains

Tested Browser: Chrome

Visit the web app at: https://kmesic.github.io/SF-Muni/

Unfortunately due to Chrome increasing security on their browser, 
they are not allowing ordinary users to access http from a https site.
And NextBus only has http access, no https.

To fix this when going to the site, 
you must click on the security icon in the top right corner of the url bar.
After that you have to click load unsafe scritps and routes and vehicles 
should load onto the map.
